# Unity and Wwise Technical Implementation Demo 
This is a sample project to test the implementation techniques wiht Wwise and Unity

Dependencies: 

Unity Version 2022.3.33f1
Wwise Version 2023.1.4.8070.8496

Contributing to the project: 

Audio:
When importing new sounds make sure to keep them as small as possible:
44,100kHz, 16 bit, and minimise channel count to mono when only using as an emmiter. 
Keep loops as small as feasibly possible.

Wwise: 
Please create and work within your own work units. 
Dont change other peoples Sharesets or Game Syncs(ATTs, RTPCs, Switches, etc). Making new ones for your own work will help to reduced merge conflicts. 

Unity: 
Please work within a new scene to consolidate any changes to that scene. 
Reuse materials in order to reduce the size of the project. 
Keep scenes clean adn reduce the number of items etc to the minimum amount. 
Please create signage in your scenes when needed to highlight important information. 
There is a TEMPLATE SCENE that is an ideal starting point for any new scenes.


Version Control: 
Please test your work first to make sure you are not pushing to main until the scene is tested and functions as expected. 
I will lock the push to main function and I would advise moving your work to branches.
